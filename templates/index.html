			<p>In “Last Men Standing,” eight long-term AIDS survivors share the stories of their lives, lives they never expected to have after surviving the most deadly years of the AIDS epidemic. The film provides emotional context both for what it was like to experience those dark years and to deal with the day-to-day struggles aging AIDS survivors continue to face. Amid debilitating and chronic health issues and growing financial and housing hardships, the men in “Last Men Standing” exhibit emotions ranging from anger to resignation to resilience.</p><p>As the first feature film produced by the San Francisco Chronicle in its 151-year history, the film is the latest chapter in the paper’s history of in-depth reporting on the AIDS epidemic and its aftermath since 1981. The film, which was directed, produced, filmed and edited by Chronicle staff visual journalists Erin Brethauer and Tim Hussin, was created over the course of ten months and was released in conjunction with a special 20-page newspaper section featuring a story by Erin Allday and an accompanying online package of stories, videos and interactive graphics.</p><p>While presenting the heartache these men experienced during the peak of the AIDS epidemic, the film also aims to shed light on these survivors’ often still precarious lives. From evictions to memory loss due to HIV- and AIDS-related dementia, the challenges these men face have persisted long past the epidemic of the 1980s and early ‘90s.Yet we see that they still find ways to usher peace and joy into their lives through relationships, artwork, humor and community.</p><p>The eight subjects of the film display extraordinary honesty and bravery in sharing their stories, offering intimate glimpses into their darkest struggles. By mingling their poignant stories with striking imagery, the filmmakers hope “Last Men Standing” creates an atmosphere where viewers can meditate on the men's words and develop a deeper understanding of their lives. Though it is a tale about AIDS survivors, the filmmakers hope it tells a larger story: how we all can find the strength to survive the worst situations and come through on the other side with open hearts.</p>

			<p>Isolation is one of the most widespread and harmful consequences of long-term survival. Drawing men out of their homes is also one of the biggest challenges facing the city and agencies that serve people with HIV.</p><p>Here are some of the social outlets that already are available, or may be starting soon.</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="medium-6 column">
			<p>Elizabeth Taylor 50-Plus Network. This San Francisco AIDS Foundation group meets weekly to provide friendship and support for long-term survivors and others affected by AIDS.</p>
			<p>Honoring Our Experience. A group started by survivor Gregg Cassin and supported by the Shanti Project that holds weekly meetings as well as weekend retreats at least three times a year. The group also hosts dances for long-term survivors.</p>
			<p>The Billys. A gay men’s club created in the late 1980s with roots in the epidemic. It’s for men of all ages, but most participants are older and many are HIV-positive. The group holds weekend retreats.</p>
			<p>Let’s Kick ASS. A grassroots support group started by long-term survivor Tez Anderson that holds weekly fitness sessions and other meetings in the Castro.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="medium-6 column">
			
			<p>Openhouse HIV support group.
